**friday · applaudiq-embed-capacitor** — default branch `master` · Orbit workspace. Every request here is a change and follows
`.claude/skills/flow/SKILL.md` automatically (`TASK_MODE=auto`: no `/task` needed):
decide where (root or repo) and the work type (hotfix | change | new), plan by type, build, gate
(`bash scripts/agent/gates.sh task <risk>`), then **ask before any commit** — never commit, push
or skip a hook without the developer's reply. Missing repo, ticket or type → **ask one question with
options**, never guess (a branch is `<TICKET>-slug`). On every line you add:
comments at most 2 lines and ≤100 characters, saying why; a linter directive is one line,
`// eslint-disable-next-line <rule> -- <why>`, never a block or `@ts-ignore` (`scripts/agent/scan-diff.sh` enforces all of it). No `scan-check:` line in your
context → run `bash scripts/agent/session-check.sh` first. Rules: CLAUDE.md § Rules · gates: docs/GATES.md.
Orbit workspace: repos live beside `orbit/`; every commit runs friday's gates, then Orbit's (branch,
header, change record at push). Work spanning repos starts at the workspace root with `./orbit work`.

## The life of a change (`/flow`)

Every request is a change: `/flow` runs without being typed (`TASK_MODE=auto`; a prompt hook says so on every message). It decides where the work belongs and which type it is — `hotfix` (no plan stop, gates `low`),
`change` (plan printed, gates `medium`), `new` (plan approved first, gates `high`) —
settles the ticket (proposed from the real diff, created only after a yes) and the branch, runs
`/task` (reads the skills, plans by type, builds, `bash scripts/agent/gates.sh task <risk>`), then
`/finalize` on the proposed commit and **asks before any commit, after every finished task**: `commit`
(the agent commits as you, that one commit only), `done` (you committed) or `stop`. After the commit: `/finalize <sha>`, `/handoff` (the QA
plan into `.orbit/changes/<KEY>.md`, tracked) and `scripts/agent/ship.sh`
(push and PR as you, then the Jira comment through the Atlassian MCP), ending with
`Next` for you. `/scan` once per session reports what governs this repo and where this file
drifted; `/review` reads a range or PR like a reviewer. A session-start hook prints a
`scan-check:` line; `trs-app agents doctor` shows which tools are wired.

## Read first

- `CLAUDE.md` (the rules, the skills table, the gates)
- `docs/README.md` (the docs index) → `docs/GATES.md`, `docs/TOOLS.md`
- the skills in `.claude/skills/` the change touches, in full

## Skills

| Load it when | Skill |
|---|---|
| Landing in this repo or starting a session (`/scan`) | `scan` |
| Planning or shipping any change end to end (`/task`) | `task` |
| Checking a finished change before pushing (`/finalize`) | `finalize` |
| Writing the QA test plan for a finished change (`/handoff`) | `handoff` |
| Any request in this repo, start to finish: ticket, branch, /task, commit question, /handoff, ship (`/flow`, automatic when TASK_MODE=auto) | `flow` |
| Reviewing a diff or a pull request line by line against the house rules (`/review`) | `review` |

Where this file or a doc disagrees with a skill, the skill wins.

Maintenance rules:
- A new or changed skill lives ONLY in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Every other tool reads
  that file through a relative link (`.cursor/skills/<name>`, `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; the
  commands also `.cursor/commands/` and `.agents/workflows/`), so an edit reaches Cursor, Codex and Antigravity
  at once. A NEW skill needs its links and its row above: run `trs-app agents upgrade` (it links
  and lists it) — never copy a skill into another tool's folder.
- A new gate is a change to `scripts/agent/agent.conf` and `docs/GATES.md` in the same change;
  the hooks read the conf.
- A new drift check is a function in `scripts/agent/drift-check.sh` (and in `session-check.sh`
  too if it is cheap), landed with the doc fix that makes it pass.
- A trap discovered while fixing a bug goes into `/task`'s standing traps in the same change.
- A new feature area — or an old area that keeps turning up in plans with no skill — gets its own
  skill: `/task` proposes it, a person approves, and it lands as its own change with its row,
  symlink and shims. The doc map never requires a skill.
- If `/scan`'s step 4 is ever stripped, delete `/scan`.

Cursor, Codex and Antigravity read this file through `.cursor/rules/project.mdc`, `AGENTS.md`
and `.agents/rules/project.md`; don't copy it into any of them.

## Rules

| # | Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Branches are `TRS-`, `AIQ-` or `INF-` plus 4–7 digits; commits are `<type>(<TICKET>): <subject>` with no bot or AI identity or attribution | the commit-msg and pre-push hooks (`scripts/git/`) |
| 2 | Comments at most 2 lines; a linter directive is one line with `-- <why>`; no secret, no new render hazard on added lines | `scripts/agent/scan-diff.sh` at pre-commit, pre-push, in /task and /finalize (gates-only profile: no app rules) |
| 3 | A touched module updates its doc (`scripts/git/doc-map.txt`) in the same change, or one commit carries a `Docs-skip:` trailer | `scripts/git/check-docs-moved.sh` at pre-push |

## Quality gates

`pnpm typecheck` · `pnpm build` · `pnpm run audit:deps`. Pre-commit runs the code rules on the staged lines → the file cap → typecheck; pre-push runs branch name → commits being pushed → docs moved → typecheck → build → dependency audit. The full table, and
what each gate proves: `docs/GATES.md`.

In this Orbit workspace a `pnpm install` runs husky (`prepare`), which points git at `.husky/_` and
bypasses Orbit's gates: run `./orbit hooks install applaudiq-embed-capacitor` from `orbit/` afterwards.
